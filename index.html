        <p>A General Assembly project where I worked in a team of 3. We all worked together across the stages of the  process with the aim to: </p>
        <strong>Create an intuitive online solution for Five Guys customers that allows them to order remotely, pay, as groups and individuals and more easily split their bill. We had 9 days to produce a high fildelity prototype.</strong>
        <p>All whilst engaging people with Five Guys core brand attributes and encouraging loyalty.</p>
        <strong><cite>"We are in the business of  selling burgers"</cite></strong>
        <p>Five Guys has 27 restaurants across the UK, with one mission. To sell tasty burgers fast. They want to improve their digital ordering to make it more intuitive and enable people to order as groups, considering how they can easily split the bill at the end.</p>
        <p>This touchpoint is also an opportunity to increase engagement and loyalty with their customers, so we wanted to ensure we considered this throughout.</p>

    <section id="research">
      <h3>The Competition.</h3>
      <p>We quickly reviewed what the competitors are offering. Ranging from in-store digital touch screens in McDonalds,to specifically designed apps such as the Gourmet Burger Kitchen app.</p>
      <img src="./images/competition.png" width="300px">

      <p>Whilst there were some good solutions out there nobody has yet provided a fully integrated way to order as a group without staff intervention and a bill splitting solution that requires minimal effort from the consumer.</p>
      <p>In terms of positioning against competitors our research showed us that Five Guys can be conceived as</p>

      <strong>"fast food at restaurant prices"</strong>

      <h3>Contextual research</h3>
      <p>We wanted to get under the skin of the consumer by understanding their journey and experience in real time. This involved visiting a number of restaurants in the competitive set and crucially Five Guys itself.</p>
      <p>We wanted to understand the current ordering system and the specific pain points from  the users point of view,  both the Five Guys customer and the servers</p>
      <img src="./images/five guys.jpg" width="300px">
      <p>Alongside the contextual research we began talking to a wider base of users. We sent out a survey with three core objectives:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1) Identify users for in-depth interview and testing  </li>
        <li>2) Explore what makes for a good restaurant experience. </li>
        <li>3) Find out about peoples existing experiences of Five Guys </li>
      </ul>

      <p>This feedback gave us clear themes to explore in  our user interviews ,which revealed the following themes:</p>
      <img src="./images/researchsummary.png" width="300px">

      <p>We used the information from the survey and the interviews to build some key personas and help identify the key pain points</p>
      <img src="./images/persona summary.png" width="300px">

      <h3>Meet our key persona Steve</h3>
      <img src="./images/Persona_Steve_Jones_V2 (1).png" width="300px">
    </section>

    <section id="opportunity">
      <p>We built an emotional path for Steve as the most regular and committed Five Guys customer likely to use an online ordering facility.</p>

      <img src="./images/emotionalpath.png"width="300px">

      <strong>Steve is stopping at Five Guys with some friends on his way to a gig. Currently this can entail a long queue, confusion around customisation and pressure to order. Orders cannot be made from the table so any extras have to be queued for again.
      </strong>

      <h3>Features and prioritisation</h3>

      <p>
        Using all the information gathered to date we started to plan the functionality and features our solution would need.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="ideation">
      <p>We took two of the key features into a design studio to identify the best way to tackle them before moving onto our first prototypes
      </p>
      <img src="./images/ideaation bill splitting.png" width="300px">
      <img src="./images/ideation customisation.png" width="300px">
    </section>

    <section id="prototyping">
      <p>First we prototyped a mobile app solution. We wanted people to be able to order in advance of entering the restaurant and to have an account so that we could build a relationship with them.</p>

      <p>This led to addressing group ordering using one persons phone, the ordering would follow a linear process Eg Burger — fries — drink, this way each order could be made on the same phone but still broken down by person.  Payment could then be made in its entirety by the App account holder or by individuals on their friends phone. Alternatively each individual could download the app and the orders would be seperate. </p>

      <p>When we user tested via a paper prototype, two things became clear.</p>

      <strong>1/ People did not always want to order in a linear way, eg preferring to add two fries at once etc.
        2/ they were not comfortable processing their payment details on someone else’s phone. 
      </strong>

      <h3>A change of plan</h3>

      <p>Following this feedback we decided to move the ordering solution into the website ( www.fiveguys.co.uk) so that a cloud based solution could be used.</p>

      <p>Each individual could easily use their own phone and link their order together. Taking forward the elements of the app that people liked, such as the easy customisation options, and clear icon orientated menus, we tested this new order process. </p>
      <p>This was well received by users so we moved on to developing the reward and loyalty aspects linked to online ordering accounts.</p>
      <p>We focused on a points based loyalty scheme linked to spend to encourage ongoing engagement, we created a build a burger game aimed to kill the average waiting time of 7 minutes between ordering and receiving the burger. And focused on incentivising social sharing.</p>

      <img src="./images/Activity Summary (4).png" width="100px">
      <img src="./images/Burger game screen (3).png" width="100px">

      <p>We also introduced a feature in the ordering process which allows users to add previous orders to their cart from the main menu page, saving the time of going through the whole ordering process again on future visits.</p>

      <h3>The site map</h3>

    </section>

    <section id="result">
      <p>You can see the current version of the prototype here</p>
      <h3>Going forward we would look to:</h3>
      <p>further develop the loyalty and rewards through tracking behaviour and more user research.
      </p>
      <p>look into p to p payment options that would support bill splitting from one order </p>
      <p>Work with Five Guys to plan how to promote the online ordering system to maximise take up.</p>
